        The Alt-Neue-Cibernetikum Gallery initiative is a responsive digital
        online art gallery. Here, users can visit several rooms organized
        according to the traditional Western Canon (Hellenistic period,
        Renaissance, Baroque, Neo-Classicism, Seccessionism) and create their
        own painting by prompting AI with certain constrains, as well as the
        frame.
